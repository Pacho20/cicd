# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

This repository is created as part of a lab exercise to learn about Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions.
The main goal of this project is to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a simple C calculator program. The pipeline includes functional testing, linting, building the application, and creating downloadable artifacts.
